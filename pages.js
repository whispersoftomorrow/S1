        content: `One night, an entire village was burned to ashes by the Cease Kingdom.

Two children — Miran and Fatma — were not there that night.
They had gone to their uncle’s house.

When they returned…
there was nothing left.

Houses reduced to smoke.
Silence where life once lived.

They searched their home —
and found their mother burned,
their father dead, still gripping an axe-like tool, as if he had fought till his last breath.

Shaken, terrified, and alone,
they took the tool and fled back to their uncle.

But war had already reached there.

Their uncle and his family tried to protect them —
helping Miran and Fatma escape into the jungle
with only a few tools and fading hope.

The uncle’s family was captured.
Enslaved.

Two children.
A burning past.
A world at war.

And in the depths of the jungle…
their real story begins.

        content: `They walked deep into the forest until they found an old, silent tent.

No one was there.

What they didn’t know was that the owner of this tent had once been part of the massacre.

They waited, hoping someone would return.
But as the hours passed, winter crept in.
The cold grew sharper.

Left with no choice, they entered the house.

They ate the food their uncle had given them and tried to rest.
But soon, Fatma’s body began to burn with fever.

Miran stayed awake all night.

He tried to calm her, talked to her softly, made her laugh when she could.
Inside, he was breaking.
Outside, he smiled — pretending to be strong.

That night, one laughed to hide fear,
and one watched the darkness to protect.

Eventually, exhaustion won.
They fell asleep.

Morning — Episode Continues

Miran woke up early.

He cleaned the house, explored the nearby area,
and built a small cooking place using soil and stones — simple, but safe.

When everything was ready,
Fatma woke up.

She slowly walked to him, held his hand, and said softly:

“Brother… I’m hungry.”

“Okay, Fatma.”

He went outside to look for food. After some time, Fatma suddenly called out,
“Brother, come here fast!”

When Miran rushed back, he saw that Fatma had reheated the food from the previous night. It was simple, but warm. They sat together and ate quietly.

Soon after, Fatma’s fever started rising again. Feeling weak, she lay down to rest.

Miran understood that food was becoming a serious problem. Before leaving, he gently said,
“Fatma, I’m going out to arrange food. I’ll come back soon.”

As he held her hand, he felt it — her hand was ice-cold.

“Please don’t go, brother,” Fatma said softly, almost whispering.

“I’ll be just outside. You can call me anytime, okay?” Miran replied, trying to sound calm.

“Okay, brother,” she answered.

Outside, Miran stood thinking desperately. Then he remembered the house. He searched every corner carefully — and finally found two apples and a watermelon. His eyes lit up with relief.

He immediately grabbed an apple and went back.
“Wake up, sister! Look, I found an apple for you. Want to eat?”

Fatma slowly replied, “No…”

Her fever was getting worse.

Miran brought firewood inside and used the matches his uncle had given him. He built a small fire and prepared a warm resting place nearby. Then he went back to Fatma.

“Come on, sister. I’ve made a warm place for you. Wake up.”

“I don’t have enough energy…” Fatma cried weakly.

Before she could finish, Miran gently but firmly lifted her.
“Hey, come with me.”

He placed her carefully near the fire.

“Oh… thank you very much, brother,” Fatma whispered.

Later, Miran cut all the fruits and returned.
“It’s 7:20, sister. Please wake up.”

Fatma tried to speak but stopped.

“For my sake?” Miran said softly.

She held his hand and slowly sat beside him. Miran felt warmth returning to her fingers — slowly, but surely. They ate together, shared the silence, and soon drifted into sleep beside the fire.
